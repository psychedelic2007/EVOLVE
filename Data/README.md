# Genomic Sequences Repository

## Overview
This repository contains raw genomic sequences for multiple species, organized into separate directories. Each directory corresponds to a specific virus or bacterial species and contains raw sequence data for further analysis.

## Directory Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
```
ðŸ“‚ CTV
   â”œâ”€â”€ <raw sequence files>
ðŸ“‚ Dengue
   â”œâ”€â”€ <raw sequence files>
ðŸ“‚ Ebola
   â”œâ”€â”€ <raw sequence files>
ðŸ“‚ Omicron
   â”œâ”€â”€ <raw sequence files>
ðŸ“‚ Xanthomonas
   â”œâ”€â”€ <raw sequence files>
```
Each directory contains raw genomic sequence files in standard formats such as FASTA (.fasta, .fa) or other relevant formats used in genomic analysis.

## Species Information
### 1. **CTV (Citrus Tristeza Virus)**
Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a plant pathogen that affects citrus trees. It is a member of the Closteroviridae family and is responsible for significant economic losses in citrus production.

### 2. **Dengue Virus**
Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus. It causes dengue fever, which is a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions.

### 3. **Ebola Virus**
Ebola virus is a member of the Filoviridae family and causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. It is known for its high mortality rate and periodic outbreaks.

### 4. **Omicron (SARS-CoV-2 Variant)**
Omicron is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It has multiple mutations in the spike protein, making it more transmissible than previous variants.

### 5. **Xanthomonas**
Xanthomonas is a genus of plant-pathogenic bacteria that affect various crops, causing diseases such as bacterial leaf blight in rice and citrus canker.

## Usage
The raw sequence data in this repository can be used for:
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Mutation detection
- Comparative genomics
- Variant analysis
- Disease surveillance

## How to Access and Analyze the Data
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genomic-sequences.git
   cd genomic-sequences
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired directory and view the sequence files:
   ```bash
   cd CTV
   ls
   ```
3. Use bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, ClustalW, or BioPython to analyze the sequences.
